* **Machine learning stochastic dynamics:**

Machine learning and stochastic dynamics have deep connections and cross-feed each other. We recenetly have developed machine-learning approaches to investigate the time evolution of stochastic dynamics: (1) propose the first approach of using the neural network alone to [solve the chemical master equation](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-023-00632-6); (2) characterize a type of [dynamical phase transition in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08266); (3) [learning noise-induced transitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05413) by multi-scaling reservoir computing. 

* **Dynamical information theory:**

Inferring mutual information from time series data remained challenging as the possible trajectory configurations increases exponentially with the number of time points. We develop a [computational framework](https://sites.google.com/view/dmipackage/home) to [quantify the dynamical mutual information](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21562-0) of intracellular signaling process, and summarize the recent progresses in this [review on quantifying information by machine learning](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6633/ac7a4a/meta).

* **Nonequilibrium and quantum thermodynamics:**

As a remarkable advance in nonequilibrium thermodynamics during the last 20 years, Jarzynski equality connects free energy changes to nonequilibrium work fluctuations. We found that the free energy change through the [Jarzynski equality is independent of magnetic field in the classical regime](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.91.042108), but can be [amplified by magnetic field in driven quantum system](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-020-00509-9). The magnetic field can also be generated by the [coupling to the heat bath](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.96.134414). 

* **Stochastic process without detailed balance:**

Stochastic transitions are ubiquitous in nature. Based on [path integral approach](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4890968), we develop a scalable numerical approach to calculate [transition rates](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-15889-2) for a class of Langevin dynamics. The computational cost is robust to varying noise intensity, beyond small noise limit. The efficient computations on transition rates enable a broader use of stochastic modeling in complex dynamics, such as [cell state transitions](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4402.pdf?origin=ppub).


* **Quantitative biology:**

To understand the complex behaviors in biological systems across scales, we have attempted to construct minimum models to describe the data and make predictions: (a) we identified computationally a [molecular circuit that control necroptosis decisions](https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/msb.20209677) such that a bimodal death-time distribution can be produced; (b) we demonstrated that chemotaxis in nutrient-replete conditions promotes the expansion of bacterial populations by modeling the [physiological effect on bacterial chemotaxis](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1733-y).

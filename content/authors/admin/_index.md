I'm currently an Associate Researcher at [International Academic Center of Complex Systems](https://zkgyy.bnu.edu.cn/index.html), Beijing Normal University, Zhuhai, China. From July 2018 to June 2021, I was a Postdoc fellow at Signaling Systems Laboratory in University of California, Los Angeles, supported by Prof. [Alexander Hoffmann](https://www.signalingsystems.ucla.edu/). I obtained my Ph.D. from Department of Physics, Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2018, mentored by Prof. [Ping Ao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JQyz-BoAAAAJ&hl=en). During July 2016 to January 2018, I was an exchange graduate student in Department of Physics, University of California, San Diego, where I got quantitative training from Prof. [Terence Hwa](https://matisse.ucsd.edu/). I completed my B.S. in honored class of [Zhiyuan College](https://zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/), Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2013. 

My research topics include stochastic process, machine learning, nonequilibrium statistical physics, information theory and quantitative biology. Combining analytical and numerical approaches, my ultimate goal is to uncover simple theoretical principles that could help understand complex nonequilibrium dynamical processes.
